The difference between a container and a virtual machine is mainly in how they virtualize resources and the level of isolation provided. Containers virtualize at the operating system level, meaning they share the host OS kernel while maintaining isolated user-space environments for each application. This approach makes containers lightweight, fast to start, and efficient in resource usage. Containers are highly portable and ideal for scenarios requiring rapid deployment and scalability, like microservices and CI/CD pipelines[4][5].

In contrast, virtual machines (VMs) virtualize an entire physical machine, including the hardware, using a hypervisor. Each VM runs its own full guest operating system, independent of the host. This leads to greater resource usage and slower start times, but also provides stronger isolation, making VMs suitable for running multiple different OSes and for applications that demand maximum security or compatibility[4][5].

To summarize:
- Containers: Share the host OS kernel, lightweight (MBs), quick startup (seconds), less overhead, process isolation, very portable—ideal for cloud-native deployments[4][5][6].
- Virtual Machines: Each has its own OS, heavyweight (GBs), slower startup (minutes), stronger isolation at hardware level, less portable—best for legacy apps or strong isolation needs[4][5][6].
